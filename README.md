# Advent of Code 2023

This is my code for the advent of code 2023.

* It is mostly in rust.
* I am trying this year to get them done the same day. (see if that goes.)
* I'm not documenting the code really, but trying to keep it clean.

## Dev Notes / Journal
* This has started to help me understand lifetimes better. I have been trying not to copy data uselessly. There are some where I still am though.
* I am trying to reuse and refactor code sometimes after solving.
* Day 5 part 2 was terrible!
* Day 6 gave me a reason to use the quadratic formula.

## TODO
* I have a utility for processing lines, which reuses a buffer. I think I can switch this to return an iterator.
